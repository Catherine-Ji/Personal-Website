                  Gum Wall:The Gum Wall is a fun and interesting place in Seattle. Located under Pike Place Market, this alleyway is covered in chewed up gum pieces in seemingly every inch of the place. Makes for a fun place to check out. Just bring a piece of gum, chew it up, and find an empty spot on the wall to place it. Don’t forget to pull out your camera to document this fun moment!
